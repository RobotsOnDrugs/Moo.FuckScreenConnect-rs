# Moo.FuckScreenConnect-rs

Moo.FuckScreenConnect is a tool to make the privacy screen for ScreenConnect Client (and Remote Utilities) semi-transparent, allowing you to see what a scammer is doing while they think their actions are secret.\
Support for remote desktop software (e.g., AnyDesk) that does not use a standard window for its privacy screen is outside the scope of this project, but may be supported in a separate project in the future.

This is a port of the original formerly private program written in C# to Rust, made simpler and easier to understand and maintain. Now with support for Remote Utilities!

Feature requests are welcome, but please file an issue here on GitHub rather than making a direct request elsewhere.
